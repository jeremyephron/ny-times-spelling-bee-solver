# Spelling Bee Solver

In an effort to convince people that certain tasks are better left to our machine overlords, this is a simple program I wrote to solve the NY Times online puzzle Spelling Bee (more information can be found at https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee) and because apparently I have too much time on my hands.

## Usage

Clone this repository, or download the ZIP file.

In the root directory of the repository run `make`.

This will create a build folder with the appropriate resource files and the
executable.

Move to the build folder with `cd build`, and then start the program with `./spellingbeesolver`.
